    <x-mast>Code of Conduct</x-mast>
    <x-container class="pt-8">
        <p class="mb-2">STEMMechanics supports the international community open to everyone without discrimination. We want this community to be a safe and welcoming place for both newcomers and current members. Everyone should feel comfortable and accepted regardless of their personal background and affiliation our projects and workshops.</p>

        <x-heading class="mt-8">Philosophy</x-heading>
        <p class="mb-2">In the STEMMechanics community, participants from all over the world come together to create and work on STEM projects. This is made possible by the support, hard work, and enthusiasm of people who collaborate towards the common goal of creating great ideas. Cooperation at such a scale requires common guidelines to ensure a positive and inspiring atmosphere in the community.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">This is why we have this Code of Conduct: it explains the type of community we want to have. The rules below are not applied to all interactions with a simple matching algorithm. Human interactions happen in context and are complex. Perceived violations are evaluated by real humans who will try to interpret the interactions and the rules with kindness. Accordingly, there is no need to hypothesize on how these rules would affect normal interactions. Be reasonable, the <a href="#code-of-conduct-team" class="link">Code of Conduct team</a> surely will be as well.</p>

        <x-heading class="mt-8">Application</x-heading>
        <p class="mb-2">This Code of Conduct applies to all users, contributors and participants who engage with the STEMMechanics workshops, projects and its community platforms.</p>

        <x-heading class="mt-8">Expectations</x-heading>
        <ul class="mb-2 list-disc pl-8">
            <li class="mb-2">Politeness is expected at all times. Be kind and courteous.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Always assume positive intent from others. Be aware that differences in culture and English proficiency make written communication more difficult than face-to-face communication and that your interpretation of messages may not be the one the author intended. Conversely, if someone asks you to rephrase something you said, be ready to do so without feeling judged.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Feedback is always welcome but keep your criticism constructive. We encourage you to open discussions, proposals, issues, and bug reports. Use the community platforms to discuss improvements, not to vent out frustration. Similarly, when other users offer you feedback please accept it gracefully.</li>
        </ul>

        <x-heading class="mt-8">Restricted conduct</x-heading>
        <p class="mb-2">Participating in restricted conduct will lead to a warning from community moderators and/or the Code of Conduct team and may lead to exclusion from the community in the form of a ban from one or all platforms.</p>
        <ul class="mb-2 list-disc pl-8">
            <li class="mb-2">STEMMechanics is committed to providing a friendly and safe environment for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, language proficiency, age, political orientation, nationality, religion, or other similar characteristics. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of participants in any form.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">In particular, we strive to be welcoming to all and to ensure that anyone can take a more active role in the community and a project. Targeted harassment of minorities or individuals is unacceptable.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Aggressive or offensive behavior is not acceptable.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">You will be excluded from participating in the community if you insult, demean, harass, intentionally make others uncomfortable by any means, or participate in any other hateful conduct, either publicly or privately.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome and will result in exclusion from the community.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Any form of retaliation against a participant who contacts the Code of Conduct team is completely unacceptable, regardless of the outcome of the complaint. Any such behavior will result in exclusion from the community.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">For certainty, any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is not acceptable.</li>
        </ul>

        <x-heading class="mt-8">Reporting a breach</x-heading>
