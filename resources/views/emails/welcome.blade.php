<p>Welcome to the community!</p>
<p>Really glad to have you here and can't wait to see you at one of our workshops.</p>
<p>You'll get information about upcoming workshops as it comes out.</p>
<p>Even though this is (of course) an automated email, just wanted to say thanks for registering and intro myself.</p>
<p>If you didn't know, I'm James and I'm the founder of STEMMechanics. I promise not to spam you, sell your data, or send you anything I don't think is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>You know a bit about me but I don't know really anything about you...</p>
<p><strong>If you're up for it</strong>, reply to this email and tell me a bit about yourself and also let me know what workshops you are interested in?</p>
<p>I read and reply to every one 😁</p>
<p>Talk soon</p>
<p>—James</p>
