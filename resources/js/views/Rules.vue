        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>
            Oh gosh, no body likes rules but to ensure that we have a fun,
            engaging and safe space for all across all our platform and
            services, we have a set of rules that everyone must follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are NOT a complete set of everything you can and can't do with
            STEMMechanics staff and its helpers determining each offense on a
            case-by-case basis.
        </p>
        <h2>Across all our services</h2>
