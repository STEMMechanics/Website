            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>
                We want to make sure everyone has fun and stays safe while using
                our platforms and services. That's why we have some rules to
                follow.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are some of the things we <strong>DO NOT</strong> allow
                anywhere:
