        <h2>Goodbye Drustcraft</h2>
        <p>
            STEMMechanics launched the Drustcraft server three years ago and
            since then, players have had countless enjoyable experiences. Cities
            were built, bosses defeated, and most importantly, a tight-knit
            community formed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maintaining the server design became overwhelming and took away the
            fun of playing Minecraft. Hence, in January, the decision was made
            to shut down Drustcraft and offer a more straightforward Minecraft
            server, retaining the beloved elements of Drustcraft like
            mini-games, bosses, and survival. Join us on the new STEMMechanics
            Minecraft server, where the Drustcraft community awaits.
