            <h2>Java or Bedrock</h2>
            <p>
                Regrettably, our support is exclusively for the Java edition of
                Minecraft. The reason for this is that we rely on the features
                unique to the Java edition, such as Resource Packs, Custom
                Items, and Modelling, which are not available in Bedrock
                (Tablet) edition.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's worth noting that if you have the Bedrock version, you may
                be eligible to acquire the Java version for free from
                <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft.net</a>. However,
                please keep in mind that the Java version is solely compatible
                with Windows or Mac operating systems.
            </p>
            <h2>Goodbye Drustcraft</h2>
            <p>
                STEMMechanics launched the Drustcraft server three years ago and
                since then, players have had countless enjoyable experiences.
                Cities were built, bosses defeated, and most importantly, a
                tight-knit community formed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maintaining the server design became overwhelming and took away
                the fun of playing Minecraft. Hence, in January, the decision
                was made to shut down Drustcraft and offer a more
                straightforward Minecraft server, retaining the beloved elements
                of Drustcraft like mini-games, bosses, and survival. Join us on
                the new STEMMechanics Minecraft server, where the Drustcraft
                community awaits.
