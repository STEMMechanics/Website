        <h3>1. The kinds of information we collect and hold</h3>
        <p>
            Depending on the particular circumstances, we may collect and hold a
            range of different information about you.
        </p>

        <h4>1.1. Individually identifiable information</h4>
        <p>
            The types of individually identifiable information we collect will
            depend on the purposes(s) for which we are collecting it. For
            example, we may ask for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>your name;</li>
            <li>your gamer tag or gamer username;</li>
            <li>contact details;</li>
            <li>identification information;</li>

                historical records of your communication and interaction with
                us;
            </li>
            <li>
                details or history of preference, interests and behaviour
                relation to transactions, products, services and activities on
                our Site;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As well as other similar Personal Information that is needed to
            register or subscribe you to our services or offers. If we ever ask
            for significantly different information, we will inform you. If you
            do not provide certain requested Personal Information to us, we may
            not be able to provide you with access to and use of the Site,
            provide you with access to our other products and services, or to
            fulfil one or more of our functions and activities applicable to
            you.
        </p>

        <h4>1.2. Non-identifiable information</h4>
        <p>
            Non-identifiable information is data that has never been labelled
            with individual identifiers or from which identifiers have been
            permanently removed, and by means of which no specific individual
            can be identified. When you visit the Site, our Company servers may
            automatically record non-identifiable information that your browser
            sends. This data may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>your computer's IP address;</li>
            <li>browser type;</li>
            <li>
                webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site; the pages
                within
                <router-link :to="{ name: 'home' }"
                    >www.stemmechanics.com.au</router-link
                >
                you visit;
            </li>
            <li>
                the time spent on those pages, items, and information searched
                on our Site, access times, dates and other statistics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Non-identifiable information is collected for analysis and
            evaluation in order to help us improve our Site and the services and
            products we provide. This data will not be used in association with
            any other Personal Information
        </p>

            We may also collect information from you online. See more
            information in clause 6.
        </p>
        <h4>3. How we hold your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
            We may store your Personal Information in hard copy or electronic
            format, in facilities that we own and operate ourselves, or that are
            owned and operated by our service providers. We take the privacy and
            security of your Personal Information seriously and we use a number
            of procedures and processes to ensure, where possible, the security
            and integrity of your Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>We protect your Personal Information by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Restricting access to Personal Information;</li>
            <li>
                Maintaining technology products to prevent unauthorised computer
                access;
            </li>
            <li>
                Securely destroying your Personal Information when it is no
                longer needed for our record retention purposes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To further secure your credit card, we also don't keep details of
            your credit card information, including the security code (or CCV
            number) that you need to input in order to complete an order using
            your credit card.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as
            completely secure. Once any information is in our possession, we
            will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse,
            loss, unauthorized access, and modification or disclosure. While we
            strive to protect such information, we cannot guarantee 100% the
            security of any information (personal or other) you transmit to us.
            Therefore, we will not be liable for any breach of security or
            unintended loss or disclosure of information due to the Site being
            linked to the Internet.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            We collect aggregated information about you which informs us about
            our users. The browser information we collect is used in an
            aggregated, anonymous manner in our internal analysis of traffic
            patterns within our Site. This information is used by us to
            administer and improve our education and training products and
            services.
        </p>
        <h4>5. When we disclose your information</h4>
        <p>
            We engage a range of third parties to provide services and perform
            business support functions for us. Some of those third parties need
            access to Personal Information in order to provide the services or
            perform the functions we require. Therefore, we may disclose your
            information to these third parties to:

            such as delivery service providers and fulfilment managers;

        </p>
        <p>
            Where we share your Personal Information with third party service
            providers, they will be contractually bound to use the information
            only for the purposes of providing the services or performing the
            functions required by us and to store the information securely, for
            example, storing in non-human readable form to ensure the security
            of your information.
