            <p>
                STEMMechanics supports the international community open to
                everyone without discrimination. We want this community to be a
                safe and welcoming place for both newcomers and current members.
                Everyone should feel comfortable and accepted regardless of
                their personal background and affiliation our projects and
                workshops.
            </p>
            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
                In the STEMMechanics community, participants from all over the
                world come together to create and work on STEM projects. This is
                made possible by the support, hard work, and enthusiasm of
                people who collaborate towards the common goal of creating great
                ideas. Cooperation at such a scale requires common guidelines to
                ensure a positive and inspiring atmosphere in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why we have this Code of Conduct: it explains the type
                of community we want to have. The rules below are not applied to
                all interactions with a simple matching algorithm. Human
                interactions happen in context and are complex. Perceived
                violations are evaluated by real humans who will try to
                interpret the interactions and the rules with kindness.
                Accordingly, there is no need to hypothesize on how these rules
                would affect normal interactions. Be reasonable, the
                <a href="#coc-team">Code of Conduct team</a> surely will be as
                well.
            </p>
            <h3>Application</h3>
            <p>
                This Code of Conduct applies to all users, contributors and
                participants who engage with the STEMMechanics workshops,
                projects and its community platforms.
            </p>
            <h3>Expectations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Politeness is expected at all times. Be kind and courteous.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Always assume positive intent from others. Be aware that
                    differences in culture and English proficiency make written
                    communication more difficult than face-to-face communication
                    and that your interpretation of messages may not be the one
                    the author intended. Conversely, if someone asks you to
                    rephrase something you said, be ready to do so without
                    feeling judged.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feedback is always welcome but keep your criticism
                    constructive. We encourage you to open discussions,
                    proposals, issues, and bug reports. Use the community
                    platforms to discuss improvements, not to vent out
                    frustration. Similarly, when other users offer you feedback
                    please accept it gracefully.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Restricted conduct</h3>
            <p>
                Participating in restricted conduct will lead to a warning from
                community moderators and/or the Code of Conduct team and may
                lead to exclusion from the community in the form of a ban from
                one or all platforms.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    STEMMechanics is committed to providing a friendly and safe
                    environment for everyone, regardless of level of experience,
                    gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
                    disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
                    language proficiency, age, political orientation,
                    nationality, religion, or other similar characteristics. We
                    do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of participants
                    in any form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In particular, we strive to be welcoming to all and to
                    ensure that anyone can take a more active role in the
                    community and a project. Targeted harassment of minorities
                    or individuals is unacceptable.
                </li>
                <li>Aggressive or offensive behavior is not acceptable.</li>
                <li>
                    You will be excluded from participating in the community if
                    you insult, demean, harass, intentionally make others
                    uncomfortable by any means, or participate in any other
                    hateful conduct, either publicly or privately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other
                    attention-stealing behavior is not welcome and will result
                    in exclusion from the community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any form of retaliation against a participant who contacts
                    the Code of Conduct team is completely unacceptable,
                    regardless of the outcome of the complaint. Any such
                    behavior will result in exclusion from the community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For certainty, any conduct which could reasonably be
                    considered inappropriate in a professional setting is not
                    acceptable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reporting a breach</h3>
            <p>
                If you witness or are involved in an interaction with another
                community member that you think may violate this Code of
                Conduct, please contact STEMMechanics
                <a href="#coc-team">Code of Conduct team</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                STEMMechanics recognizes that it can be difficult to come
                forward in cases of a violation of the Code of Conduct. To make
                it easier to report violations, we provide a single point of
                contact via email at:
                <a href="conduct@stemmechanics.com.au"
                    >conduct@stemmechanics.com.au</a
                >. If you are more comfortable reaching out to a single person,
                you are also welcome to contact one or more members of the team
                using their personal emails listed below, or via direct
                messaging on community platforms where they are present.
