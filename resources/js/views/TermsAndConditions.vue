            Enforcement of the Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and
            the absence of enforcement of these Terms in some instances does not
            constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the Terms in other

            expectation or promise that the Sites will not contain any content
            that is prohibited by such Terms. Although STEMMechanics has no

            Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Sites or in a separate

            history). In addition, we may retain archived copies of your User
            Content and cached copies of your User Content may still be
            available for some period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            By posting User Content to the Sites, you represent and warrant that

            you grant in these Terms; (c) the User Content is accurate and not
            misleading or harmful in any manner; and (d) the User Content, and
            your use and posting thereof in connection with the Sites, do not
            and will not violate these Terms, our Site Rules, any other
            applicable STEMMechanics terms, guidelines or policies or any

            information regarding the Sites, STEMMechanics and our products or
            services (collectively "Feedback"). You agree that Feedback is
            non-confidential and shall become the sole property of

            be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of the

            you expect to be paid or want to continue to own or claim rights in
            them; your idea might be great, but we may have already had the same
            or a similar idea and we do not want disputes.

            If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or
            for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed

        <SMHeader id="15" text="15. Ordering online" class="pt-16 pb-2" />
        <p>
            Upon completing your order and submitting it through the checkout
            system, an order reference number will be issued to you via a
            confirmation email. We will not process your order until it has
            passed our internal validation procedures, for the purpose of
            preventing credit card or payment fraud. Upon processing your order
            and receiving payment we will send you a confirmation email which is
            your Tax Invoice. We reserve the right to refuse service or supply
            of the products or to terminate the contract and/or your account at
            our sole discretion. If we cannot process your order after receiving
            payment, we will contact you using the details entered at the
            checkout. By placing an order with stemmechanics.com.au, you declare
            that will not be on-selling the product(s) to another person(s) for
            financial gain.

        <p>
            In the instance that you need to cancel or edit your order of a
            physical item; if you fail to notify us before your order has been
            dispatched, you can incur a return to sender delivery fee of $25. To
            avoid any fees associated when cancelling/editing your order, you'll
            need to notify receive confirmation from a STEMMechanics customer
            support team member before the order has been dispatched from our
            premises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Digital items cannot be cancelled or edited after receiving payment.

        <p>
            All prices are shown in Australia dollars (AUD). All items are
            subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity
            limits on any order, to reject all or part of an order and to
            discontinue products or services without notice, even if you have
            already placed your order. All prices are subject to change without
            notice. Prices displayed on the Sites may vary from those in the
            store or from store-advertised prices. All purchases on applicable
            products include GST at the rate of 10%.
        </p>
        <SMHeader id="17" text="17. Errors" />
        <p>
            We attempt to be as accurate as possible and eliminate errors on the
            Sites; however, we do not warrant that any product, service,
            description, photograph, pricing or other information is accurate,
            complete, reliable, current or error-free. In the event of an error,
            whether on the Sites, in an order confirmation, in processing an
            order, delivering a product or service or otherwise, we reserve the
            right to correct such error and revise your order accordingly if
            necessary (including charging the correct price) or to cancel the
            order and refund any amount charged. Your sole remedy in the event
            of such error is to cancel your order and obtain a refund.

        <p>
            If the colour or size you want is not listed in the "Choose Your
            Colour/Size" drop-down box on the Product Information page, it is
            not then available for ordering. Please check back later. If the
            colour or size you want has an Out of Stock label, it is on
            backorder and available for pre-order. Sometimes we will not know in
            advance that product is unavailable, so when you place items in your
            Cart you will be asked if you would like to pre-order them. If you
            indicate yes, the item will be sent to you once it becomes
            available. Note that some items may be backordered or unavailable
            even if the Sites indicate that they are in-stock, and adding an
            item to your Cart does not guarantee the availability of that item.
            If you have items on pre-order that you would like to cancel, please
            contact us.

        <p>
            You agree that all of your transactions with or through the Sites
            may, at our option, be conducted electronically from start to
            finish, and that any oral conversations may be recorded. If we
            decide to proceed non-electronically, those transactions will still
            be governed by the remainder of these Terms unless you enter into
            different terms provided by us. You are responsible to print or make
            an electronic a copy of these Terms and any other contract or
            disclosure that we are required to provide to you.
        </p>
        <SMHeader id="20" text="20. Payment" class="pt-16 pb-2" />
        <p>
            We currently accept Visa and Mastercard online. Only valid credit
            cards or other payment method acceptable to us may be used and all
            refunds will be credited to the same card or, in our discretion,
            other method. By submitting your order, you represent and declare
            that you are authorized to use the designated card or method and
            authorize us to charge your order (including taxes, delivery costs,
            handling and any other amounts described on the Sites) to that card
            or other method. If the card (or other method) cannot be verified,
            is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your order may be
            suspended or cancelled automatically.

            class="pt-16 pb-2" />
        <p>
            You may not place orders with the intention to immediately
            on-forward the products to another person in a business transaction
            (via marketplaces such as eBay etc), without the express written
            permission of STEMMechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the instance that you, a customer who has received a
            STEMMechanics order via an on-forwarder, then you forfeit your right
            to make; a) a warranty claim or b) refund or exchange with
            STEMMechanics. As per Australian Consumer Law or Consumer Guarantee,
            the reseller who has conducted the transaction must address the
            warranty and refunds directly with the manufacturer at their own
            cost and loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a reseller who has conducted the transaction is requesting that
            STEMMechanics send the product directly to the customer then they
            are engaging in Misleading Breach of the Law. The two laws are:
            Section 18 of the act which relates to Passing Off, and Trading on
            the Goodwill of Another Business - and, section 29 1 G which relates
            to Affiliation (misleading the customer that the seller works for
            the Retailer, in this case STEMMechanics). This can be made obvious
            by the reseller's customer receiving a Tax Invoice for the products
            with STEMMechanics letterhead and other documentation supplied by
            STEMMechanics Outdoors, misleading the customer to think they are
            buying from a reputable store instead of a reseller, often just a
            consumer. Exceptions to this would be if the reseller has an ABN or
            ACN that relates solely and specifically to reselling products
            purchased from a Retailer, to their customer base. They will still
            be responsible for warranty and after sales service but this is
            allowed under the Law.
